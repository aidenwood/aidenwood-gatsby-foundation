Search Engine Optimisation has in the last 2 years has risen quickly to the top of every business owners priorities, especially due to our lifestyle changes from COVID-19. Never before have we relied on Google’s search ranking algorithm to create leads for businesses on a consistent basis. Myself, being a long-time Google Partner and Web Developer, I had become used to being the only person in the room screaming for more effort and budget towards SEO and CPC campaigns. Suddenly, we find that most businesses are running CPC campaigns on a number of platforms.

These businesses, now a solid 18 months into the void of slowed economies, are very much feeling like their campaigns are stretching to their limits. With the addition of iOS14’s massive privacy changes, again has there been another shift in how businesses plan to assess their digital marketing strategies as well as their SEO management strategies. I have watched hundreds of managed digital marketing accounts lose steam in recent months after some of the most successful months only just before. As businesses scramble to reevaluate ad spend and tech departments labour focus, it will be extremely interesting to watch which campaigns hit the nail on the head with customers, and if ANY businesses can see the same amazing ROAS and other key indicators that we’re almost too easy in 2020.

Many businesses that had never even considered having a marketing team or had never even run a digital marketing campaign, are now completely reliant on their campaigns. These businesses have had to quickly adapt any way possible during the start of the pandemic, and a lot of their campaigns have not been able to capture and understand the data behind their ad spend quickly enough to understand and adapt ad spend in recent months.

Digital Marketing Strategies in 2021.

Businesses that are succeeding the most in the organic search engine optimisation strategies the most in the current highly competitive market are generally sticking to 3 simple rules that have rung true from the start of Google’s push to educated the public about working with their algorithm, to create the most favourable results for your business. Understanding how your businesses information passes through Google and how it is displayed to potential customers on the other end is a serious key to unlocking a profitable business.

1. Strategy / Campaign Development within your Entire Team
2. A Definable Target Audience for SEO & CPC
3. Ad Design and Copy that Targets the Genuine Needs of this Audience

A strong strategy needs to be based off of current goals of your business and it’s members, take the time to hear their thoughts and what they are feeling can be the pain-point that converts your customer. Now that the strategy is defined, the target audience needs to be made clear, especially in the ways that it can be defined to a search engine algorithm. Only by thinking about the nets of online targeting this early in strategy development, can an ad strategy be sure that it can reach the appropriate eyes. Now that we are feeling confident there, we need the ad to communicate with said eyes and brain. Use pain points that are extremely currently relevant in volatile times to prove to your customers that you are the business that is adapting to their needs. Once you have a loop of customers being targeted well with copy that speaks directly to their needs, will the machine learning behind Google successfully take over and begin to find the cheapest and most successful advertising impressions available to your business.

Keeping Digital Marketing Campaigns Successful at Scale.

The next problem that every business is facing today, is how they can move from their first round of successful campaigns, to start scaling to nationwide audiences without losing important key indicators such as CPM and ROAS. Digital marketing is unarguably the cheapest and most effective form of advertising currently available. When used to target local sections of the population it can be easily used to advertise to tens of thousands of local customers a cost of around $3-$4 CPM. The problem a lot of the people we speak to at SiteLab and in general digital marketing discussion everywhere is: moving these campaigns to a state-wide or nation-wide reach will instantly blow CPM out of proportion, having a knock on effect across all other indicators.

The main cause of this problem is leveraging customer data to prove business relevance is easy at a local level, however when trying break through to larger markets, this data can not be accumulated or leveraged the same. Google knows that the average person living in Victoria is not as interested in Gold Coast travel deals as someone from on the Gold Coast or Brisbane. To prove nationwide SEO relevance your business needs to have a strong SEO strategy in place and being executed by both your marketing and development teams, while you can let your other employees keep to doing what they do best, running your business and servicing your customers.

This is a problem for both ends of the party. A lot of people will be surprised to first hear this, but Google is a business too! They have a responsibility to keep their product at the top of its game, and they do that by providing quality search results. It is in Google’s interest to provide the most clicked link (across the average) at the very top of their rankings. The simple bit is, website SEO rankings are impacting digital marketing ad spends more every day. Businesses that continue increasing their campaign budgets to compete, without being able to provide a better website user experience, are the ones forking out the most.

Successful Digital Marketing Strategies for 2022.

Everyday more and more businesses are creating an AdSense account. With the ability to create Smart Campaigns being streamlined by the Australian Google team, these businesses are only compounding the problem without ever really seeing true performing search results or creating customer data to leverage. The businesses that are going to stay ahead will only be the ones that understand how digital marketing must pivot in the coming months.

With business only being created within the Google ecosystem over 80% of the time, this is not something that you can stick your head in the sand and survive. Businesses must being improving their website user experience and site load speed from today! Core Web Vitals have been impacting Google Search rankings for months now and I have already seen first hard the profit lost to businesses that couldn’t adapt before competitors.

Improving user experience is the first step, next a much stronger stance on content creation and SEO strategy must be taken in a regular way. This will keep your rankings climbing in the keywords you require them to be, not wasting your sites possible Page 1’ers on unnecessary keywords.
